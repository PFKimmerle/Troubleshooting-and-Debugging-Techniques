# Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques

The focus is on identifying issues in scripts, optimizing performance, and applying debugging strategies.

## Overview

Each subfolder in this repository represents a specific task. The folders include practical exercises using Python scripts, logs analysis, performance optimization, and error resolution.

## Folder Structure

- **Debugging Python Script**: Contains a Python script (`greetings.py`) that prompts for user input and displays a message. Accompanying this is an error log (`error.txt`) that helped in identifying and fixing issues in the script.

- **Debugging and Solving Software Problems**: This folder includes a more complex Python script (`report.py`) that processes data from a CSV file over the network and provides insights into debugging networked applications.

- **Fix a Slow System with Python**: Includes a script (`dailysync.py`) designed to optimize and speed up a system by automating the synchronization of files using Python's multiprocessing capabilities.

- **Fix Errors with a Crashing Script**: Contains data (`CSVs` and `data.txt`) related to employees, which is used in conjunction with Python scripts to diagnose and solve crashing issues.

## Key Learnings

- Developed a systematic approach to identifying and resolving bugs in software.
- Learned to use Python for writing scripts that automate and optimize system tasks.
- Gained experience with performance troubleshooting, particularly in syncing large sets of data efficiently.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills by debugging scripts with complex data processing requirements.
